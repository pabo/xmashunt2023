# Christmas Hunt 2023

This is a christmas scavenger hunt for my parents. The clues lead them to slips of paper hidden in their house (for 6 months!), each with a letter written on it. Once they have all the letters, they need to solve the jumble to find their gift.

Lots of CSS atrocities in here due to last minute time constraints. Don't judge me!

## Demo

For example, there's a letter hidden in a Good House Keeping cookbook, on the page for a quich lorraine recipe:
